# c64-demo1
Malfunctions and my first C64 approach during a coding session in november 2020. Consists of three sections:

* Title text with floating colors
* Flying circles moving in a sinus wave pattern which change colors 
* Scrolling text on the bottom which shows our disclaimer ;)

Music was composed with goattracker. Code written for and with Kick Assembler. Makes use of macros to beautify 6502 assembly and increase readability. Can be compiled with:

```
java -jar your/path/KickAssembler/KickAss.jar Demo.asm
```
